## Computers Help Humans: AI goes to work

### Human intelligence versus artificial intelligence
To have a conversation about artificial intelligence (AI), we need a practical definition of human intelligence (HI). Let’s consider that human intelligence is the ability to reason, solve problems, and learn. These activities involve a complex interaction between cognitive functions like perception, memory, language, and planning.

People do these things naturally because human intelligence enables us to learn from past experience, adapt to new situations, and handle abstract ideas. Humans can use learned knowledge to adapt to, shape, and change their environment.

### Types of AI
AI can process data and make certain kinds of predictions faster and more accurately than humans. But it isn’t magic and it isn’t all-powerful.

Let’s look at different levels of AI and what they can accomplish.

- Weak AI
Many companies use weak AI to automate tasks to get results quickly and at lower costs. Weak AI outperforms humans in narrowly defined tasks. Think of a chatbot that answers customer service questions, facial recognition on Facebook, buying recommendations on Amazon, or apps that can convert voice to text. Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri all demonstrate weak AI.

- Augmented Intelligence
Augmented intelligence supplements human intelligence, helping humans make better decisions. It doesn’t replace humans. Instead, it boosts their expertise and improves their productivity. IBM Watson for Oncology, for example, helps health professionals identify key information in a cancer patient’s medical records, and it recommends several possible treatments along with estimates of how each one might work. Its recommendations are excellent, based on constantly updated research in cancer science. But it doesn’t choose the patient’s treatment. That’s up to the health professional. In other words, augmented intelligence helps humans become faster and smarter at the tasks they’re performing.

- General AI
General AI doesn’t exist yet. But when it does, it will be a form of “whole brain emulation,” where a machine can think and make decisions on many different subjects. It will drive the computers you see on science-fiction video, talking to humans about many subjects, while operating entire cities or starships. Today, general AI is a goal rather than a practical technology. It will require decades of additional research and more powerful computers to achieve.


### Artificial Intelligence | Machine Learning | Deep Learning

- Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence describes machines that exercise capabilities usually associated with human intelligence. Current research in AI focuses on learning, reasoning, problem solving, perceiving, and understanding human language. You’ll learn more in the next course about how advances in AI will help make us all smarter, communicate, solve problems for society, and change the way we work.

- Machine Learning
Machine learning, or ML, uses algorithms to learn from data. Given an input of data, ML can perform statistical analysis to determine an output. As with every kind of computing, the more data the machine is given (assuming that this data is valid), the more accurate is its output. ML uses human-like capabilities such as analysis, self-training, observation, and experience to learn without being explicitly programmed!

ML comes in three flavors: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. ML relies on these three types of algorithms. The application of any one of these algorithms depends on the relation to available data you are processing, the output that you need from your model, or maybe even the possibility of retro-feeding data to improve the algorithm. If it sounds complicated, it is.

One amazing aspect of machine learning is its ability to modify itself when exposed to more data. It’s dynamic and doesn’t require human intervention to make changes! So as it’s exposed to more data, it continues to learn and improve its results.

Machine learning is what prompted the bank to contact you about what might be someone using stolen information from your credit card. But it’s not perfect. Machine learning is also what threw off your Netflix recommendations after someone in your family watched a weird comedy on your account.

- Deep Learning
Deep learning, or DL, is a subcategory of machine learning that focuses on statistical models when it solves problems. It uses an artificial neural network, made of algorithms inspired by the human brain, as it solves complex problems by performing tasks over and over again many thousand times, each time tweaking it a little to improve the outcome. DL requires big data and enormous computing power, but has tremendous potential as we move toward the goal of general AI.

Imagine the complexity of decisions to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound with accuracy that might exceed human performance. How about driverless cars?

Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling the computer to recognize a stop sign or to distinguish a pedestrian from a street light.


### Other technologies help AI
AI will create new opportunities for society, business, and for consumers. But for AI to be more widely adopted, other enabling technologies need to mature alongside it.

Cloud, for example, is already helping businesses access and share computing power they wouldn’t normally be able to afford. This shared technology, in turn, will enable those businesses to operate new training algorithms and data management required by AI.

Other emerging technologies will also be vital to AI’s growth. Visual recognition, natural language processing, predictive analytics, and even the Internet of Things (IoT) will empower AI, leading to new applications in medical devices, security, customer service, and more!
